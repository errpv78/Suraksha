    <button type="button" class="collapsible">&#43    The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>According to the International Research Centre for Women, almost 47 percent of girls are married before the age
        of 18. Currently, India ranks 13 in the world when it comes to child marriages. Since child marriage has been
        steeped into the Indian culture and tradition since centuries, it has been tough eliminating it. The Prohibition
        of Child Marriage Act was made effective in 2007. This act defines child marriage as a marriage where the groom
        or the bride are underage, that is, the bride is under 18 years of age or the boy is younger than 21 years.
        Parents trying to marry underage girls are subject to action

        Special Marriage Act. It is not applicable to the state of Jammu and Kashmir and also extends to intending
        spouses who are Indian nationals and living abroad.

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">&#43    Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>According to this act, taking or giving of dowry at the time of the marriage to the bride or the bridegroom and
        their family is to be penalised. Dowry system, giving and taking of dowry, is a norm in India. Dowry is often
        asked of the bride and her family by the groom and his family. The system has taken strong roots because women
        after marriage move in with their spouse and in-laws. Also, over the centuries, the lack for economic
        independence of women and the taboo towards divorce has resulted in bride burning. When demands for dowry even
        after marriage are not met by the girl&#39s families, many women are tortured, beaten and even burnt. It is one
        of the major challenges that our society is grappling with. Women openly complaining about it has helped to
        spread the word and encourage other women to take a stand.
